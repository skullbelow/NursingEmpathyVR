# NursingEmpathyVR

As a result of the pandemic, nurses have shown a tremendous need in developing empathy in palliative care nursing. The goal is to develop a virtual reality simulation focusing on generating a better understanding of empathy before entering the industry to prepare the nurses for hands-on experience in end-of-life care and interacting with the emotional loved ones of patients.

This project utilized Unity and the HP Reverb G2 Omnicept headset for the creation of a training environment that takes users through an introduction video that explores the concept of empathy, 360 degree training scenario videos, and a likert scale survey. During the scenarios the PPG  sensor and Tobii VR4 Integration Platform build into the HMD are used to poll heart rate, pupilometry, and gaze tracking data that is then stored to a .csv file.
